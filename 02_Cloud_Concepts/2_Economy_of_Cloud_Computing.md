# The Economy of Cloud Computing

**Capital Expenditure** is money spent by a business on acquiring or maintaining fixed assets such as: land or equipment

**Operational Expenditure** is an ongoing cost for running a product, business, or system on a day-to-day basis including annual costs

---

Moving to cloud computing can reduce Capital Expenditures significantly in favor of "pay-as-you-go" cloud operational expenditures like server and storage space.

## Pricing

**Hourly Pricing**: VMs & App Services
**Consumption Pricing**: Pay for resources used

With consumption pricing you pay either per execution of a function or per second of resource usage or a combination of the two.

For example, Azure Functions are built based on per-second resource consumption and execution.
