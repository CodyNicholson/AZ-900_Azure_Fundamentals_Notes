# Azure Advisor

The Azure Advisor will provide recommendations to improve availability, save costs, increase reliability, and more. If I have 10 virtual machines and 2 of them are used very infrequently, the Azure Advisor will recommend we turn off those 2 virtual machines or at least make them smaller in size. 

Security is also a large part of the recommendations. Whether it is the number of users, FTPS should be required on Functions app, enabling Azure defender, or many other suggestions.
